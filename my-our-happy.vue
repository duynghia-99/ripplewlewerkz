                                        Thank you Ripplewerkz and team for the great work in actualising the website that we wanted. Entire workflow process and communications was smooth and efficient. A lot of help and advice was given as well for technical stuffs which was out of the scope of work, this is something we greatly appreciate! Highly recommend Ripplewerkz for anyone that is looking for web designing solutions!

                                        <p>Lionel from Ripplewerkz is one of the most professional if not the most professional web designers I have worked with. The first project we worked on together is my personal blog (violetlim.com). At that point, we have actually not met face-to-face, but via our online communication, somehow Ripplewerkz knew exactly what I wanted. I am so impressed by what they have done (check it out, and you will too!), and I absolutely love how they have successfully incorporated all the different elements I wanted into my blog.</p>
                                        <p>Ripplewerkz was also always willing to go the extra mile. When my previous host company lost all my data, they helped me to recover my data, and help me get my blog up and going again with my new host. Since then, we have worked on many other projects together â€“ my companyâ€™s new website (lunchactually.com), as well as corporate identities for our new product lines. Ripplewerkzâ€™s service is always prompt and they are always willing to listen to my suggestions and make necessary changes.</p>
                                        <p>In fact, Ripplewerkzâ€™s so good that part of me wants to keep them as Singaporeâ€™s best hidden gem. ðŸ˜‰ So, if you are looking for a web designer, look no further</p>

                                            We are very pleased with the service provided by Ripplewerkz, especially during our recent website enhancement, where the team was very professional and quick to respond during and even after the project. Overall it has been a great experience working with the team, and we would definitely consider working with them again on other projects.

                                        <p>Thank you Ripplewerkz! We would like to compliment specifically Ms Tam Choi Yee and Mr Peter Su for going the extra miles to ensure that they are able to deliver what we are looking for in creating a visually impressive and professional website. They have never failed to provide any assistance upon request, and offered prompt and effective solutions to issues faced for the website and web hosting. They are very attentive towards the needs of their customers as they are very open to our suggestions and ideas, and will make sure to incorporate what we had shared into the web design. We are grateful for the prompt technical support and training sessions provided in maintenance and managing of our website. And we really appreciate the patience, hard work, professionalism and craftsmanship in every detail.</p>
                                        <p> Once again, Thank you Ripplewerkz, All the best! We definitely look forward to further opportunities working with your team.</p>
